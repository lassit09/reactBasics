ECMAScript6 (ES6)
-------
* We can use Babel to convert ES6 code to ES5 and vice versa.
* var is function-scoped
* let is block-scoped
    * let won't let you use the same variable name
    * let can be updated
    * should use let more than const
* const is block-scoped
    * const cannot be reassigned
    * if const is an object, it is mutable
        * can't change the value of the object but can change it's properties
